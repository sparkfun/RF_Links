These wireless transmitters and receivers easily fit into a breadboard and work well with microcontrollers to create
a very simple wireless data link. The original legacy VirtualWire library that is used in this GitHub repo can be found [here](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/VirtualWire/). However, we recommend using the latest [RadioHead library](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/), which supports more architectures.

_Note: The 315MHz RF Link receivers are almost identical to the 434MHz RF Link receivers. SparkFun does everything in our power to make sure you receive the product you requested. However, if you are concerned you may have received the incorrect product you can verify which version receiver this is by running a simple test circuit with it's corresponding RF Link transmitter (i.e. make sure to use the 315MHz RF Link transmitter with the 315MHz RF Link receiver)._
